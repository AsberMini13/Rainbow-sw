PSilent (Always/Bind Hotkey) - the perfect silent aimbot

PSilent Melee Throw is the perfect silent aimbot for melee throws

PSilent Visible Only - the perfect silent aimbot for visible enemies only

PSilent Radius Hitchance (0-100) - chance of a shot when the aimbot is working perfectly silent. The maximum hitchance is set the 
closer to the center of your fov from the enemy. The more likely it is to work. Minimum hitchance is the opposite.

PSilent Custom Spread (0.0-1.0) - a separate setting for a perfectly silent aimbot. For example, you can use the weapon's overall spread as 1, and you will shoot with full spread. If you set the psilent to zero spread and press the psilent button, you will shoot with zero spread, but only with the psilent.

Silent Melee (Always/Bind Hotkey) - Silent melee (always/bind hotkey)

Targets (Resources/Player&amp;NPC) - silent melee aimbot. It can be used for melee combat or for ore/wood mining, depending on what you install. For players/npcs, it will hit the target bone you set at a distance of 2-4m. For ore/trees, he will farm and hit markers.

Hitchhiking - desynchronization of hitchhiking can be used to completely exclude disabled people.

Autoshot - autoshoot desynchronization can be used simply for autoshoot. You don't need to do anything, just click the desync button.
Powershot

Min Bullet Queue - Powershot desynchronization can be used to fire bullets with the maximum value. If you disable this feature, autoshoot will start shooting when the number of bullets is zero. With powershot, your desync will take care of this and any bullets that could have been used for the shot will be used later. A minimal burst of powershot bullets can be used for an instant kill. For example, you can set it to 3 and target the head bone. If you shoot, the player will die instantly, but if your dispatcher has not collected the minimum number of bullets, he will not shoot until he reaches the required number.

Instant hit - an instant hit can be used to skip the travel time of bullets and powershot bullets. An instant hit may skip the time you set in "Death Time".

Extend On Mountable - extend on mountable desynchronization can be used to increase the desynchronization of meters on a horse/car/other vehicle.

Customize Max Desync Time (0.0-1.0) - maximum desynchronization time (optimal desynchronization time 0.95).

Time padding (0-20) - desync time can be used to exclude disabled players, but you sacrifice desync meters. (Optimal desynchronization time is 3-5
